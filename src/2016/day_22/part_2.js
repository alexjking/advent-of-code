// Part 2
// Move the data from the top right corner to the top left corner.
// So algorithm as follows:
//
// Starting from the top right corner, do a BST.
// So for all of the Goals neighbours, count how many moves it would take to move them into either of the neighbouring nodes.
// I should check for how many empty spaces there are. If there is one, that might be key to finding out how to do it all.
// Looks exceedingly complicated though, so will wait a while for that one!
